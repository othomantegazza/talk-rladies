## Tools for communcation

Rmarkdown Shiny

---

## Why

- Me biologist
- welcoming and empowering community
- fits with R-ladies

Withhout knowing HTML allowed me to communicate my R results in HTML reports,
+ puts you in control, so by using it you learn and improve HTML

---

## How

One plain text file 

- code, do the analysis
- text,  explain and communicate your analysis

Run this file: results from code (tables, figures, numbers), style text (so that it reads nicely)

Basic: literate programming
