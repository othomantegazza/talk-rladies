## Tools for communcation

<!--
R has great tools for communication, we will focus on rmarkdown and knitr
and many packages that are built upon them
Shiny for interactiva apps
-->

Rmarkdown, knitr, Shiny.

## Why?

<!--
looking forward to do R-ladies talk
Tools of R that made the difference for me: rmarkdown
Afterwards, I was glad to see that it is considered one of 
the most developed aspects of R compared to python

<!--
A report boils down to some text, explain
some code: produce results
Plus we need a header
-->

a header

```{yaml}
title: "An rmarkdown report"
author: "Otho Mantegazza"
```

some text

```{markdown}
# An example of rmarkdown

Below you'll find a very basic plot
```

some code

```{r, eval = FALSE}
plot(mtcars$mpg, mtcars$hp)
```
  
---

## How?

<div style="float: left; width: 48%; padding: 3px;">

### Code

<img src="img/R_logo.svg" alt="hex-rmarkdown" height="200" width="200">

Generate your results, plots.

</div>
<div style="float: right; width: 48%; padding: 3px;">

### text

<img src="img/Markdown-mark.svg" alt="hex-rmarkdown" height="200" width="200">

Explain our results and the reasoning behind them.

</div>

<!--

One plain text file 

- code, do the analysis
- text,  explain and communicate your analysis

Run this file: results from code (tables, figures, numbers), style text (so that it reads nicely)

Basic: literate programming

-->

## Markdown

```{markdown}
# This is a header

This is a paragraph. In my younger and more vulnerable years my father gave me
some advice that I've been turning over in my mind ever since.
"Whenever you feel like criticizing any one," he told me, "just remember that all
the people in this world haven’t had the advantages that you’ve had."

## This is a level 2 header

- this is a dotted list
- item 2
- item 3

This is another paragraph. Reserving judgments is a matter of infinite hope.
I am still a little afraid of missing something if I forget that, as my father
snobbishly suggested, and I snobbishly repeat, a sense of the fundamental
decencies is parceled out unequally at birth. 
```

## Markdown

```{markdown}
### This is a level 3 header

1. This is an ordered list
2. item 2
1. item 3, dotted numbers are fixed automatically

### You can also add links and images/videos

# Let's Try One!

<!--
Open one Rmarkdown file and show header
R code and text.
- markdown text, highlight with *, paragraph with empty line
- code is knitted in text with ```
- many options for code, also inline
- header, metainformation


Output: 
- docx: with template
- html - best
  - style with css, show live?
- parametrized?
