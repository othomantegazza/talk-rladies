# About me

I've learned R programming during my PhD in biomolecular science at the University of Milan. My research was producing extensive datasets, and I wanted to be able to analyze them autonomusly. Since then, I never stopped.

R has been fundamental in my next two jobs, where I used it to explore and model genomic data. First at HHU/CEPLAS, where I used it to find targets to engineer photosynthesis in plants, later at IRD, where I used it to explore the domestication of Asian and African rice.
