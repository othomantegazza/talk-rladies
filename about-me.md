# About me

I've learned R during my PhD in biology at the University of Milan. At that time, I was producing extensive datasets in my research, and I wanted to be able to analyze them autonomously.

Later, R has been fundamental in my two postdocs, where I used it on a daily basis to explore and model genomic data. First at HHU/CEPLAS, in Duesseldorf, where I used it to find targets to improve photosynthesis in crops, later at IRD, in Montpellier, where I used it to explore the genetics of Asian and African rice.
