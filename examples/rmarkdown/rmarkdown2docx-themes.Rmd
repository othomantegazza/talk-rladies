## Theme 

To style an rmarkdown report in `.docx`, you have to [provide a reference `.docx` file](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/articles_docx.html).

This one is modified by [Kieran Healy's template](https://github.com/kjhealy/pandoc-templates/tree/master/templates).

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

# Other Lines of Code

```{r}
data("mtcars")

dim(mtcars)

with(mtcars, plot(mpg, disp))
```
